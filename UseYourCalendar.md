### Adding Your Squadron Calendar to Google Calendar

If you don’t have a Google account associated with the email you provided, you will need to create one.

The calendars created are Google calendars, and to access your squadron calendar, you will need a Google account. You can use your email (it does NOT have to be a Gmail.com address) to create a Google account. [Learn how to create a Google account here.](https://github.com/at3davis/my_CAP_Project/CreateGoogleAcct.md)

### What to Expect

- Your calendar and the squadron calendar will be indicated by **different colors**.
- You can **toggle calendars on and off** in your calendar view. Be cautious not to turn off a calendar you need.
- **Wing calendar items** will appear on your squadron calendar.
- **Squadron activities** will NOT be included on the wing calendar.
